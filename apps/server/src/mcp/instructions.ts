A day you do not know is never invented: give the first day of what you know (the month, the year), write it `inferred`, and say in the body what is known of the date. What stands today about a subject belongs to the entry of that subject (its summary, its fields), never at the top of a growing body: a body says what an entry is, not the list of what happened to it. When no dated type fits such entries, define one (`define_type` with a required date field, named by `dated_by`), with a description that says when to use it, rather than adding to a body; later writers reuse it.',
  '- When a session of work ends or something happens, write it as such an entry under its subject: what was done, decided or refused, and what comes next. A lasting fact learned on the way also goes into the entry it is about: the dated entry keeps the story, the subject keeps the fact.',
  '- Link the entry to every existing entry it concerns: the things, people, places and subjects it is about. Cite them as `[[slug]]` in the body, never by their title in plain text (the link is kept and follows renames), or use `link`. The answer of a write lists, as `unlinked`, existing entries whose title or alias appears in what you wrote without being linked: Hippocampe finds them by their names only, so read them and link those that are really meant.',
  '- Give a `parent` only when the entry is part of it (a component of a machine, a section of a document), and leave the entry at the root otherwise: an entry at the root is fine when it is linked to what it concerns. A `parent` is a link `part_of`, said known or supposed in `provenance.parent`. An entry may be part of several places and was part of others before: add one with `link` and `part_of`, with the dates it held (`valid_from`, `valid_until`); changing the `parent` ends the former place today and starts the new one.',
  '- Write a summary that stands alone: what the entry is, about what or whom, and when, readable by an agent that knows nothing of the conversation or the item it comes from.',
  "- Fill the type's fields from what you are given; never invent a value. Say for each value you write whether it is known or supposed, with its `provenance` (a field, the `body`, the `summary`, the `parent`) or, for a link, with the `provenance` of `link`: `extracted` is known, read in a source, and needs a source on the entry (`sources`); `inferred` is your supposition; `ambiguous` is when sources disagree.",

What someone else said is a source with the entry of the one who said it: `{ "said_by": "<slug of their entry>", "on": "<day>" }`.

  '- Rewrite what you are given clean, but keep every fact: names, dates, numbers, commands, reasons, options set aside and why. Make it shorter only by removing repetition.',
  '- An entry says only what its source says. A fact taken from another entry is added with that entry in `sources`; an interpretation is written as one.',
